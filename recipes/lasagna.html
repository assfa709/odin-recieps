    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe by Chef John breaks down the processes that yield Persian rice's 
        signature qualities: fluffy grains, the tahdig layer, and some bonus potato 
        tahdig nestled on top. It's not quite how my grandmother makes it, but it's 
        definitely worth trying.
    </p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
                Place water and kosher salt in a pot; bring to a boil. 
                Add rice; cook and stir for exactly 7 minutes. Drain.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
                Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover bottom of the pot with 1 layer of potato slices. Sprinkle cumin and salt over potatoes. Cook until potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes; top potatoes with rice to form an even layer. Reduce heat to low and place butter slices over rice.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
                Top the pot with a layer of clean paper towels, then place the lid over the towels. Steam until rice is fluffy, about 45 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Grind saffron threads with a mortar and pestle. Mix crushed saffron with 1 ½ tablespoons hot water in a large bowl. Add a couple of spoonfuls of rice to saffron mixture and stir until rice is yellow.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Spoon remaining rice into a serving bowl. Top with saffron rice and line the edges of the bowl with potatoes. Garnish with parsley.</p>
